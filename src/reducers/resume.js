I have developed technical communication and leadership skills via my experience as a teaching teaching assistant for Intoduction to Computer Systems at UBC and extensive volunteering experience.  I have continuously challenged myself with new languages, frameworks and methodologies. I have a very strong interest in full stack development and have recently been experimenting with React to learn a solid front-end framework as you will see from my Github repos. I have acquired experience with the back-end in Node.js and developed a fully functional database that supported a custom query language (no database apis were used).",
